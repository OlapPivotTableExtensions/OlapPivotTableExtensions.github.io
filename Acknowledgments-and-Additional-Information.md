### Acknowledgments and Additional Information

Special thanks go to:
* Marco Russo and his post on [viewing the MDX](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/marco_russo/archive/2007/01/18/display-the-mdx-query-of-an-excel-2007-pivottable.aspx) behind a PivotTable
* The fantastic [Excel team blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/excel). Particularly, this [post](http://blogs.msdn.com/excel/archive/2008/02/05/common-questions-around-excel-2007-OLAP-PivotTables.aspx) described how to add private calculated members to a PivotTable was helpful.
* Misha Shneerson and the very helpful blog post about building Excel add-ins for [64-bit Excel](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mshneer/archive/2010/02/24/taking-com-shim-wizards-to-64-bit.aspx).
* This blog post describing a fix for an error message experienced while using an [embedded Excel document inside Word](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsofficedeveloper/archive/2008/04/11/excel-ole-embedding-errors-with-managed-addin.aspx).

Additional Resources:
* [Designing SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services Cubes for Excel 2007 PivotTables](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=9982)
* [Excel Services Compatibility Checker Add-In](http://blogs.msdn.com/cumgranosalis/pages/excel-services-compatibility-checker-download-page.aspx)
* The [PivotPower](http://contextures.com/xlPivotAddIn.html) add-in which contains some useful PivotTable extensions. Most of the features are focused on non-OLAP PivotTables, though some of its features are useful with OLAP PivotTables. Particularly, the [Reset Captions](http://contextures.com/xlPivotAddIn02.html#Formatting) feature is very handy.
* [PTPower](http://www.sqlserverpower.com/UtilityDetail/PTPower.aspx) is a different free Excel add-in which lets you add calculated members to PivotTables. While not currently as rich in other features, its major plus is a more user-friendly interface for creating the calculations.
* [Vivid](http://www.varigence.com/products/vivid.html) is a different Excel add-in centered around PivotTables. It is not free, but it has some very impressive features.
* [SmartPivot](http://www.devscope.net/products/SmartPivot/default.aspx) is a different Excel add-in that has a few useful features.
